# What it is?

* Great for taking data and building visualizations of it.
* Fantastic for updating data sets (live data, interactive visualizations).
* Great for animating visualizations
* Dom manipulation library. i.e. great for manipulating html and svg, useless for canvas (just doesn't even make sense in the context).
* Declaritive not imperitive
* A total mindfuck
